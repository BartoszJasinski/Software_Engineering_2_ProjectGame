\section{Software development methodologies}
The team implements scrum methodology. Every Monday of the semester the team conducts a three-hour long meeting. In the first 15 minutes next sprint is planned, rest of the meeting is intended for coding. Sprints last one week and begin each Monday after the team's meeting. Additionally, the team holds two more meetings a week to discuss the ongoing process. Other than that the team shall maintain a constant connection via Slack or other messengers.

The team should utilize GitLab's issue board for creating backlogs, planning sprints and organizing workflow.

During meetings the team shall produce following documents:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Updated issue board
\item Meeting protocol
\item Backlog (every sprint-planning meeting - Mondays)
\end{enumerate}

According to scrum methodology, team members are assigned following roles:

\begin{description}
\item[Product owner] Bartosz Jasiński
\item[Scrum master] Filip Grajek
\end{description}

Additionally, every team member holds developer's responsibilities. Issue board administration is responsibility of Kamil Grabowski and meeting protocols are responsibility of Tomasz Koter. Any other not predicted responsibilities shall be distributed on the fly.


\section{Software technologies}
The project is designed in .NET C\# using Microsoft Visual Studio. Every member of the team already has two years of experience with this environment and there was no other environment mutual for the whole team, hence the choice was obvious.



\section{Schedule}
\subsection{Project schedule}

The whole project can be divided into four main phases. The length of those phases is determined by project deadlines. Every phase has to be ready two days before the given date, the last two days are used to fix bugs found during the "testing" deadlines. \\

\begin{longtable}{| p{1cm} | p{4cm} | p{3cm} | l | l |}
\hline
\textbf{Id} & \textbf{Phase} & \textbf{Estimated time} & \textbf{From} & \textbf{To} \\ \hline
1 & Communication & 16 days & 6.03.2017 & 21.03.2017 \\ \hline
2 & Game & 21 days & 22.03.2017 & 11.04.2017 \\ \hline
3 & Cooperation & 36 days & 12.04.2016 & 17.05.2017 \\ \hline
4 & Championship & 11 days & 18.05.2017 & 28.05.2017 \\ \hline
\end{longtable}

Each phase is divided into smaller tasks, that are assigned man-hours. Those hours also include time for unit test, which are written after each task.

The numbers in the table above indicate how many hours each team member spends on each task. Most often two to three people work on a task, while the rest is doing another one. Every person has to spend at least one hour on each task to review and understand the code.
